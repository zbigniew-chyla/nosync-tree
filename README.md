## nosync::tree - `nosync::request_handler<>` for fetching tree structures

This is small header-only library with an implementation of `nosync::request_handler<>`
that can fetch the whole tree-like data structure using `nosync::request_handler<>`
provided by the caller to fetch input data for each individual tree node.

An example application is available in `src-testapp` directory.
